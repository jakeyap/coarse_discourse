They also added a new kind of agility course known as Rooftop courses, the advantage to training this way is that you earn tokens (they appear along the course for you to gather as you are doing obstacles) which can be traded for a weight reduction set of clothing. They also added a bunch of stuff to slayer. Added elite clues and tons of new rewards a few days ago. Those are the things that come to mind for me, there's definitely a bunch of other things I'm forgetting though.",
